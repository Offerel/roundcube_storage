# Roundcube elFinder Plugin
Directly integrate elFinder as App in to Roundcube with SSO. You can find elFinder at GitHub (https://github.com/Studio-42/elFinder). 

# Issues
Please create issues in the [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/Offerel/roundcube_storage/issues) issue tracker. I have disabled the issue tracker in GitHub.com because the repo there is only used as a workaround and for compatibility reasons.

# Installation
- Extract the downloaded archive into Roundcubeâ€™s plugin directory `<roundcube>/plugins/` and rename it to `storage`.
- Copy config.inc.php.dist to `config.inc.php`
- Change `$config['storage_basepath']` in this config.inc.php to the root path for elFinder. This defines, where the root for the filemanager starts. Use the variable %u for the Roundcube username.
- Activate the plugin in /config/config.inc.php in the way that you add it to the active plugins array, like `$config['plugins'] = array('storage');`
