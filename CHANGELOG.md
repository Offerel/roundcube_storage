 - There is now a special connector.roundcube.php file, so that you can use this, instead of connector.minimal.php
 - Configuration of basepath is now done in config.inc.php
 - It's now possible to save E-Mail Attachments in the configured storage. For this, there is a new config parameter in config.inc.php to specify the right path. If this path doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

### v1.0.1
 - I have changed the authentication. Now I use directly the Roundcube session to login and build the path for elFinder. This is more secure than my previous approach.
 - Addes skin support for classic skin 

### v1.0
 - This is the first release and somewhat like a first test. You have to download and configure elFinder yourself, since this is not the goal of this plugin.
